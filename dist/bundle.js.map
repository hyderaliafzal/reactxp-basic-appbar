./~/reactxp/dist/web/utils/MouseResponder.js","// Rebound\n// =======\n// **Rebound** is a simple library that models Spring dynamics for the\n// purpose of driving physical animations.\n//\n// Origin\n// ------\n// [Rebound](http://facebook.github.io/rebound) was originally written\n// in Java to provide a lightweight physics system for\n// [Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home) and\n// [Chat Heads](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca)\n// on Android. It's now been adopted by several other Android\n// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n// example.\n//\n// Overview\n// --------\n// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n// a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer function is\n// notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\n// equilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation\n// range to drive animated property updates on your user interface\n// elements (translation, rotation, scale, etc).\n//\n// Example\n// -------\n// Here's a simple example.
